Notes:

app.py - looks the same as it has previously
    - app.py behaves like it has previously as well

static directory - 
    - contains foo and foo.html, which contain the same text

foo
    - when accessing localhost:5000/static/foo
        - foo file is downloaded to computer
    
foo.html
    - load as we would have expected, displaying plaintext to browser
